# About this repo
This repo was created by Thomas Deckers for the course STAT 545B 2023W1 at UBC.

It is the final assignment for the course, designed to test usage of strings and
functional programming in R.

Specifically, the code in this repo completes two exercises:
1. Creating a chart of the frequency of words in Jane Austen's *Emma*
2. Writing a function that transforms text into a custom version of Pig Latin
